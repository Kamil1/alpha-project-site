# What is Alpha Project?

Alpha Project is a UBC Club which collectively works on a single software engineering project over the course of the school year. Students are assigned specific roles on the team, and must collaborate to create a product which is beneficial and tailored to the UBC community. The final product is then released to be freely downloaded by the UBC student population. All projects produced by Alpha Project are open source and not used for profit.

# Events

Alpha Project is designed to enrich the lives of all it's members. It begins with The Hub. Once the new SUB is constructed (Jan 2015), Alpha Project members will have access to an exclusive office space, where all members come to relax between class, socialize, work on homework, and collaborate on the project. The Hub is where Alpha Project lives.

Alpha Project offers continuous learning opportunities with renown faculty members, students, and alumni coming to speak about various aspects of Computer Science. Due to the size of the club, these guest speakers can focus on issues and topics which are relevant to the project and members of Alpha Project.

Play Hard. Work Hard. Alpha Project hosts regular social events, providing members with time to create real friendships. Between classes, at club events, while working, or at a night out, you will always find a time to hang out with people who share your interests and passions.
